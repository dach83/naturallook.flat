# jQuery.hoverDelay.js

Check the [demo page](http://ronency.github.io/hoverDelay/)

### What?
hoverDelay.js is a small and useful jQuery plugin that provides the very commonly wanted effect of "hover", but with configurable delay for the "in" and "out" events.

###Why?
For cases in which you want the hover functions to kick in only if the user really intended to enter/ leave your element, for example: Let's say you have a navigation menu, and hovering over a menu item opens its submenu items (which can be a heavy operation). In this case you probably wouldn't want the "hover" functions to act if the user only moved the mouse across your menu, but only if he stopped at a single menu item... That's what hoverDelay.js is for :-)

###How?
It uses the jQuery .hover() method, and wraps it with the logic that handles the delays. See the [demo page](http://ronency.github.io/hoverDelay/)
